<p>This is how the traditional voting acts, The voting system currently being used by the University’s students union is a paper based system, in which the voter simply picks up ballots sheets from electoral officials, tick off who they would like to vote for, and then cast their votes by merely handing over the ballot sheet back to electoral official. The electoral officials gather all the votes being cast into a ballot box. At the end of the elections, the electoral officials converge and count the votes cast for each candidate and determine the winner's election.</p>
